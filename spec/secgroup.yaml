  description: |-
  
   A security group defines the incoming and outgoing security rules
   which can then be assigned to a node when a node is being created.
   Once the node is up the connection to and from the node will be
   decided by the security group rules, in addition to any other possible
   rules applied on network devices or from the instance"s firewall
   settings.
   A security group may have one or multiple rules and a node may be
   associated with one or more security groups.
